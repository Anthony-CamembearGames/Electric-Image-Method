# Electric-Image-Method

This python program calculates the electrical capacitance matrix of a set of conductive spheres. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance for more on the theory.

### Updates

12/03/2015 : Updates to the program to include the possibility to calculate the Capacitance Matrix over a conductive plane + Readme updates

Roadmap : 

* Capacitance Matrix over a conductive surface [done]
* Capacitance Matrix over a dielectric surface [work in progress]
* Capacitance Matrix over a 2 layer dielectric surface with complex permitivities [work in progress]
* Capacitance Matrix over a multi-layered dielectric surface with complex permitivities [standby]
