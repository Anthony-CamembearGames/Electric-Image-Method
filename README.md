# Electric-Image-Method

This python program calculates the electrical capacitance matrix of a set of conductive spheres. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance for more on the theory.

For the moment it is only capable of calculating the capacitance matrix in a homogeneous medium with the ground at infinity.

Future possibilities will include :

1. Capacitance Matrix over a conductive surface
2. Capacitance Matrix over a dielectric surface
3. Capacitance Matrix over a 2 layer dielectric surface with complex permitivities
4. Capacitance Matrix over a multi-layered dielectric surface with complex permitivities
